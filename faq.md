# FAQ for GitForLaw

1. What is the Value Proposition of GitForLaw?

   1. For the Executive Data Scientist:
      - Many of you will already be using git for managing code and other workflows.  GitForLaw brings your legal dependencies into the same versioned system of provenance and collaboration.
   2. For the Client:
      - You may need to learn some about git, but that can also be simply served up to you like a desktop where all the relevant materials are laid out, and all the histories of the file (the mattter) are there along with who contibuted what.
   3. For the Supporting or Supervising Lawyer:
      - Git, especially when used with ProseObjects, allows you to leverage forms and the work of colleagues and communities.  It is a deal archive that can be a deal room, can be a system of delegation, rely upon shared materials (public resources or private transaction information).
      - It is not much different than managing a number of files - except that it keeps a history of all changes. 
      - GitForLaw, and especially CommonAccord.org allow you to publish forms and starting points for negotiation, useful for accelerating or standardizing frequent transaction types, and to collaborate on standards formation. To practice at "the top of your ticket."

2. Is GitForLaw "centralized", "top down", are there throttle points?
   - No. Indeed, it is entirely "open" in all the important senses.  
        - *Open Source Code*: All the infrastructure, except GitHub itself, is open source code.  git, the editing tools, even the code implementing ProseObjects, is all open source, and very widely used, with strong communities. We hope soon to rewrite the ProseObject code in Python, in a modular way, further opening via the Python community.
        - *Open Source Legal*:  The great majority of the current materials are open sourced, sometimes under licenses like CC0 or CC-By.  Or informally, generally the authors of legal documents (lawyers or administrations) do not assert copyright.  Rightly so, as we can write around any claimed uniqueness. 
        - *Open To Modification*:  The critical feature of both Git and of ProseObjects is that any solution can be tweaked, at any time.  This is essential for any work that a lawyer is involved in.  A model may be good, but it will require modification.  A draft to the other side will have a reply, and there may be many backs and forths before it is is time for signature, which is another back and forth. The next transaction might be like the prior one except ....  Both Git and ProseObjects are "locked open" in this sense. (Where there is a fully appropriate model for a transaction, no lawyer is needed.)  
        - *Decentralized Data*:  You can run everything locally, on a server of your choice, and on your laptop.  You can share the data - including deal points, forms, tweaks and supporting exhibits - only as you wish.  You can even "clone" all the ProseObject repos into your local instance, so that the central system knows only that someone downloaded a bunch of materials. This all comes courtesy of how Git was designed - for local autonomy.
        - *Ontological Independence*:  This fancy phrase means that you can use whatever naming schemes you want.  If you are using an existing ProseObject solution, you will likely want to use their names for things - such as the "Buyer.Name.Full" or the "Conf.Except.Mandatory.sec".  But you are free to override at any time within the ProseObject paradigm. To make it "Confidential.Exception.CourtOrdered.sec" or even "Confidential_Exception_CourtOrdered_sec".  And the French can use their labels for their materials.  And if at any point you want to reorganize an existing solution, you can "fork" the repo.
        - *Contributions*":  If ever you find something that should be improved, or differentiated into another use case, Git lets you "fork" the solution and do your own thing.  If you feel so moved, you can suggest the improvement/variation back to the maintainer of the original solution, by a "pull-request."  Odd name, easy idea.
